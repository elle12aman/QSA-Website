          Hello community! I'm Arshi, I am the Founder and Executive Director of
          Queer South Asians.<br /><br />
          As a 19yr old immigrant youth who had left home to escape violence
          after coming out to family, getting to meet queer south asian folks
          and engaging in story sharing was what kept me alive. I know how
          isolating it can be, especially for immigrant south asian queer folks
          to find the magical and elusive chosen family that queers are always
          told we will have. We get told "it gets better" in our darkest hours
          but what I believe in is that we can make it better for ourselves by
          taking active interest in community building. There are life changing
          roles we can each have by simply showing up and caring about each
          other's journeys. We are never alone in our struggles and we can
          empower a loving and thriving LGBTQ South Asian community together by
          sharing our skills, resources and lived experiences.

          Hello community! I'm Aarya, I am the Director of Operations of Queer
          South Asians.<br /><br />
          As a new immigrant in Montreal, I often found myself feeling isolated
          and out of place in spaces that weren't catered to racialized
          communities. Eventually, I got tired of searching for those spaces and
          gave up on trying to build community there. When I moved to Toronto, I
          realized that if I couldn't find these spaces, I would create them or
          work with folks who do. And thus began my journey with QSA.<br /><br />
          I wish to continue creating more events that bring joy and belonging
          to the Queer South Asian community in Toronto.

          Hello community! I'm Aman, I am the Web Coordinator of Queer South
          Asians.<br /><br />
          I discovered the QSA's instagram page when i was randomly browsing
          through the reels one night. I saw that they were looking for some
          volunteers for the annual community dinner and being a big introvert i
          decided to be bold and apply for it. Ever since I have loved and had a
          lot of fun spending time with the folks at QSA and continued
          volunteering for more events.<br /><br />
          My favorite event so far has to be the community dinner, mainly
          because it was my first time being socially out as a trans person
          around new people and i was very proud of myself for that.<br /><br />
          I think QSA does a wonderful job of creating a supportive and
          welcoming environment for the LGBTQ south asian community. Moving
          forward i wish we continue with the same with increasing passion and
          provide a place for everyone to feel safe, have fun and be comfortable
          just being themselves.

          Saw a post about the QSA Community Dinner taking place and call for
          volunteers, decided to apply. Pure chance that it became more than a
          one time thing, but l love volunteering with QSA!<br /><br />
          I aim to create a warm and welcoming community for all queer south
          asian folks so QSA can become a home away from home for them.
